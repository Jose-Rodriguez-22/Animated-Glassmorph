# Animated-Glassmorph
This is a UI/UX design practice from youtube channel "Online Tutorials"

:moon:
using a new tool called "parallax" credit to https://cdnjs.com/libraries/parallax, I was able to learn new animations for the background of the page.<br/>
:mountain:
some Javascript was required in order for the backroung objects to move by using the "document.getElementById" of the background scene. <br/>
As I followed the video, I documented how the data attributes "data-depth-x/y" made the movements of the images of the background possible, something new to learn.

:pencil:
in this second video, it was presented that the user can write their username and password, with key details such as: <br/>
- the placeholder titles dissapearing as soon as I click the input boxes
- password placeholder that hides the password 
- and the submit button that styles differently than the rest

Future applications:
- i do plan to use this style for another personal portfolio that goes in depth of other projects, which means relearning user input and storing user information 
through Django's authentication system as i've done with the Money Count project
